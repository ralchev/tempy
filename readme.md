# TEMPY

The purpose of Tempy is to:
- read data from a temperature sensor attached to a Raspberry Pi;
- get temperature data from OpenWeatherMap;
- write both together with the current time to a database (SQLite) every 15 minutes.

It served me as a way to get to know programming with Python, from the one hand, and record temperature data from my apartment.

Comments about my code are welcome!
